# JavaScript

This project uses JavaScript with the following styles:

- All models will be classes with singular naming (i.e. `User` for the `users` table)
- Indent with 2 spaces ONLY
- Variables will be camelCase
- Constants will be in all caps with underscores (i.e. `MAX_USERS`)
- All functions will be in camelCase
- All code files will be lower case with underscores.
- Markdown files will be lower case with hyphens.
- All application logic will go in the `lib` directory
- All configuration will be done with environment variables, using a `.env` file.
- Do not export a class directly, use module method instead to create the instance you need (aka "factory")
